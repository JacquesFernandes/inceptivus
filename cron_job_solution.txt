DB -> Database
PSV -> PHP Session Variable

When user logs into teknack, the resources amounts as well as resource rates are fetched from DB and stored in PSV

Register every tick as an incremental number in DB (i.e. when teknack starts, the "NumTicks" value in db will be 0)

Each user will have a "OldTicks" PSV

As and when user updates local-map page (the one with the local map as well as resources), difference between "Numticks" and "OldTicks" is generated (as a var "TickDiff" in PSV)

"TickDiff" is multiplied to the resource rates (in php) to get the new resource values (and is stored in respective PSVs)

On shifting from main event page (or logging out), data in PSV is sent back to DB
