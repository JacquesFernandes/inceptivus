Will be changing the entire UI once its put into the main page.
Right now I took way too long to think about such a simple idea and didn't want to waste more time so will leave it at this for the time being.

Changes to be made:
 -- Numbers to boxes that highlight
 -- (d)Calculation of regen
 -- Submission of the values

 -- Update table grid as per row column values and not playerid value
 -- Passing finished calculation to main
